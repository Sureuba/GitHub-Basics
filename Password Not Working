If you get this failure: 
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/seng438-winter-2024/seng438-a1-Sureuba/'

means:
It looks like you are trying to authenticate to a GitHub repository using password authentication over HTTPS, but GitHub has removed support for password authentication since August 13, 2021. Instead, GitHub now recommends using token-based authentication.

To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):

Go to your GitHub account settings.
Click on "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens" > "Generate token."
Give the token an appropriate name, select the required scopes, and generate the token.
Use the Personal Access Token for Authentication:

Instead of your GitHub password, use the generated Personal Access Token as the password when prompted for authentication.
Example Git command using the Personal Access Token:
git clone https://username:token@github.com/seng438-winter-2024/seng438-a1-Sureuba.git

Replace username with your GitHub username and token with the Personal Access Token you generated.

For GIT ON COMMAND LINE:
you can set up a credential manager to cache your credentials. This way, you don't have to enter them every time.

git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

After following these steps, you should be able to clone or push to the GitHub repository without encountering authentication issues.
